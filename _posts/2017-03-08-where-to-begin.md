title: Where to begin?
---

So are you exited about all the news about machine learning you've heard lately? I sure was a year ago, and it does not take too much times to find a significant amount of information to start with. Fortunately now there is a lot to start so I wanted to make a list of videos, articles, books that I've found to be incredible useful to start with machine learning.

***[I will keep updating this list once I remember others]***

## Shorts and cool

### [Machine Learning | El Mahdi El Mhamdi and Lê Nguyên Hoang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLie7a1OUTSagZB9mFZnVBgsNfBtcUGJWB)

I came across this incredible guy explaining a lot of machine learning concepts in videos as shorts as 10 minutes, which is impressive. I am still surprise it does not have more subscriber but is just a matter of time.


### [Andrew Ng's introduction to machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

A classic among classic, this course is a perfect balance to awake the interest on machine learning, it is not incredibly deep in math but it does not at all ignore it. Concepts like linear models, regularization, logistic regression, and neural network are covered and true be told a lot of use start

## A bit longer, Lectures

We all love coursera and udacity courses, they are indeed very handy for grabbing a quick concepts, but more often than not there lack some very important mathematical proof that deepens understanding of our knowledge, here is a list of the one that I happen to find most useful.

### [John Hopkins University](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsktEryM0y0WqtXIMjnHcZA/videos)

### [Math 301 Washington University](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEirPnFv_2QbvzrM67SnKPA/videos)

### [University British Columbia](https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfNandoDF/videos)


## Blogs to get started


### [Reddit learnmachinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/)
Incredible the amount of information is always posted in this subreddit as well as [/r/artificial](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/) and [/r/machinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning/) is hard to keep up with, but certainly you get anything and if you don't you can always ask. (Politely of course)

### [Mostafa Samir](https://mostafa-samir.github.io/)

Even though there are only three articles, they are all well written and a good quick intro read to have a feeling of the math without being too overwhelmed.
