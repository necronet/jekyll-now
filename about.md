Who am I? Well not sure. But I can tell you what I'm in love with. Statistical learning and artificial intelligence concepts have been my latest passion; I've been a developer for the better part of 10 years now, with humble beginning in php and java I have been working with several other languages in different platforms. Android seems to be a recurrent topics in my career, spending several evening in working in multiple application. 

I love being a Nicaraguan Fulbright scholar and a being part of the YLAI program, both opportunities have give me the chance to meet the most amazing individuals from different countries around the world.
